        <h2>About Solar Panels</h2>
        <p>Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, are devices that convert sunlight into electricity. They are made up of silicon cells that absorb photons from sunlight, creating an electric field across layers of silicon. This electric field generates direct current (DC) electricity, which can be converted into alternating current (AC) electricity for use in homes and businesses.</p>
        <p>Solar panels come in various types, including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film panels. They are typically installed on rooftops or in open spaces with access to sunlight. Solar energy systems can be grid-tied, off-grid, or hybrid, depending on the user's needs and preferences.</p>

        <h2>About Solar Energy</h2>
        <p>Solar energy is a renewable energy source that is abundant and environmentally friendly. It reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Solar energy can be harnessed using solar panels installed on rooftops or in large solar farms, providing clean electricity to power homes, businesses, and communities.</p>
        <p>In addition to generating electricity, solar energy can be used for heating water, powering vehicles (e.g., solar cars), and charging electronic devices. Advances in solar technology, such as solar batteries and smart inverters, have made solar energy more efficient, reliable, and affordable for consumers.</p>
